# TL;DR: temporarily install a UI hook set the icon.
#
# Long form:
#
# in the IDAPython `plugin_t` life cycle,
#   - `init` decides if a plugin should be registered
#   - `run` executes the main logic (shows the window)
#   - `term` cleans this up
#
# we want to associate an icon with the plugin action - which is created by IDA.
# however, this action is created by IDA *after* `init` is called.
# so, we can't do this in `plugin_t.init`.
# we also can't spawn a thread and do it after a delay,
#  since `ida_kernwin.update_action_icon` must be called from the main thread.
# so we need to register a callback that's invoked from the main thread after the plugin is registered.
#
# after a lot of guess-and-check, we can use `UI_Hooks.updated_actions` to
#  receive notifications after IDA has created an action for each plugin.
# so, create this hook, wait for capa plugin to load, set the icon, and unhook.
