capa detects capabilities in executable files.
You run it against a PE, ELF, .NET module, or shellcode file and it tells you what it thinks the program can do.
For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor, is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to communicate.

# download and usage

Download stable releases of the standalone capa binaries [here](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/releases). You can run the standalone binaries without installation. capa is a command line tool that should be run from the terminal.

To use capa as a library or integrate with another tool, see [doc/installation.md](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/blob/master/doc/installation.md) for further setup instructions.

For more information about how to use capa, see [doc/usage.md](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/blob/master/doc/usage.md).

# example

In the above sample output, we ran capa against an unknown binary (`suspicious.exe`),
and the tool reported that the program can send HTTP requests, decode data via XOR and Base64,
install services, and spawn new processes.
Taken together, this makes us think that `suspicious.exe` could be a persistent backdoor.
Therefore, our next analysis step might be to run `suspicious.exe` in a sandbox and try to recover the command and control server.

By passing the `-vv` flag (for very verbose), capa reports exactly where it found evidence of these capabilities.
This is useful for at least two reasons:

  - it helps explain why we should trust the results, and enables us to verify the conclusions, and
  - it shows where within the binary an experienced analyst might study with IDA Pro

```

capa uses a collection of rules to identify capabilities within a program.
These rules are easy to write, even for those new to reverse engineering.
By authoring rules, you can extend the capabilities that capa recognizes.
In some regards, capa rules are a mixture of the OpenIOC, Yara, and YAML formats.

Here's an example rule used by capa:

```yaml
rule:
  meta:
    name: hash data with CRC32
    namespace: data-manipulation/checksum/crc32
    authors:
      - moritz.raabe@mandiant.com
    scope: function
    mbc:

```

The [github.com/mandiant/capa-rules](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules) repository contains hundreds of standard library rules that are distributed with capa.
Please learn to write rules and contribute new entries as you find interesting techniques in malware.

If you use IDA Pro, then you can use the [capa explorer](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/tree/master/capa/ida/plugin) plugin.
capa explorer helps you identify interesting areas of a program and build new capa rules using features extracted directly from your IDA Pro database.
