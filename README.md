capa detects capabilities in executable files.
You run it against a PE file or shellcode and it tells you what it thinks the program can do.
For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor, is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to communicate.

Check out the overview in our first [capa blog post](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/07/capa-automatically-identify-malware-capabilities.html).

# download and usage

Download stable releases of the standalone capa binaries [here](https://github.com/fireeye/capa/releases). You can run the standalone binaries without installation. capa is a command line tool that should be run from the terminal.

<!--
Alternatively, you can fetch a nightly build of a standalone binary from one of the following links. These are built using the latest development branch.
- Windows 64bit: TODO
- Linux: TODO
- OSX: TODO
-->

To use capa as a library or integrate with another tool, see [doc/installation.md](doc/installation.md) for further setup instructions.

For more information about how to use capa, including running it as an IDA script/plugin see [doc/usage.md](doc/usage.md).

# example

In the above sample output, we ran capa against an unknown binary (`suspicious.exe`),
and the tool reported that the program can send HTTP requests, decode data via XOR and Base64,
install services, and spawn new processes.
Taken together, this makes us think that `suspicious.exe` could be a persistent backdoor.
Therefore, our next analysis step might be to run `suspicious.exe` in a sandbox and try to recover the command and control server.

By passing the `-vv` flag (for very verbose), capa reports exactly where it found evidence of these capabilities.
This is useful for at least two reasons:

  - it helps explain why we should trust the results, and enables us to verify the conclusions, and
  - it shows where within the binary an experienced analyst might study with IDA Pro

capa uses a collection of rules to identify capabilities within a program.
These rules are easy to write, even for those new to reverse engineering.
By authoring rules, you can extend the capabilities that capa recognizes.
In some regards, capa rules are a mixture of the OpenIOC, Yara, and YAML formats.

Here's an example rule used by capa:

```yaml
rule:
  meta:
    name: hash data with CRC32
    namespace: data-manipulation/checksum/crc32
    author: moritz.raabe@fireeye.com
    scope: function

  features:
    - or:
      - and:
        - mnemonic: shr
        - number: 0xEDB88320
        - number: 8
        - characteristic: nzxor
      - api: RtlComputeCrc32
```

The [github.com/fireeye/capa-rules](https://github.com/fireeye/capa-rules) repository contains hundreds of standard library rules that are distributed with capa.
Please learn to write rules and contribute new entries as you find interesting techniques in malware.

If you use IDA Pro, then you use can use the [IDA Pro plugin for capa](./capa/ida/ida_capa_explorer.py).
This script adds new user interface elements to IDA, including an interactive tree view of rule matches and their locations within the current database.
As you select the checkboxes, the plugin will highlight the addresses associated with the features.
We use this plugin all the time to quickly jump to interesting parts of a program.
