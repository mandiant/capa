### rules


capa uses a collection of rules to identify capabilities within a program.
The [github.com/mandiant/capa-rules](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules) repository contains hundreds of standard library rules that are distributed with capa.

When you download a standalone version of capa, this standard library is embedded within the executable and capa will use these rules by default:

```console
$ capa suspicious.exe
```

However, you may want to modify the rules for a variety of reasons:

  - develop new rules to find behaviors, and/or
  - tweak existing rules to reduce false positives, and/or
  - collect a private selection of rules not shared publicly.

Or, you may want to use capa as a Python library within another application.

In these scenarios, you must provide the rule set to capa as a directory on your file system. Do this using the `-r`/`--rules` parameter:

```console
$ capa    --rules /local/path/to/rules    suspicious.exe
```

You can collect the standard set of rules in two ways:

  - [download from the Github releases page](#download-release-archive), or
  - [clone from Github](#clone-with-git).

Note that you must use match the rules major version with the capa major version,
i.e., use `v1` rules with `v1` of capa.
This is so that new versions of capa can update rule syntax, such as by adding new fields and logic.

Otherwise, using rules with a mismatched version of capa may lead to errors like:

```
TODO
```                

You can check the version of capa you're currently using like this:

```console
$ capa --version
TODO
```

#### download release archive

The releases page is [here](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/releases/).
Find the most recent release corresponding to your major version of capa and download the ZIP archive.
Here are some quick links:
  - v1: [v1.6.3](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/releases/tag/v1.6.3)
  - v2: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
  - v3: [v3.0.3](https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/releases/tag/v3.0.3)

#### clone with git

To fetch with git, clone the appropriate branch like this:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules.git -b v3 /local/path/to/rules
```

Note that the branch name (`v3` in the example above) must match the major version of capa you're using.

  - v1: `v1`
  - v2: `v2`
  - v3: `v3`
